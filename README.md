# Dataset Description

This dataset was created as part of a study to determine the most prevalent malware families based on occurrence frequencies from submissions to MalwareBazaar, a well-known malware exchange platform among cybersecurity practitioners. The dataset encompasses data collected over a 1.5-year period, from September 1, 2022, to February 29, 2024. 

During this period, MalwareBazaar received 205,437 submissions, out of which 177,757 were assigned one of 862 signature values, indicating their suspected malware family. This dataset specifically focuses on 50 of the most commonly observed malware families. After deduplication, the dataset represents 147,652 samples, accounting for 83.06% of the submissions with identified signatures.

Additionally, to evaluate malware Command & Control (C&C) communication, over 2,500 sandbox runs from Recorded Future Triage were manually reviewed. This was to identify instances where a reference malware sample successfully connected to its C&C server. The network traffic from these sandbox runs was captured in PCAPNG format, with TLS decryption applied where possible, providing a solid foundation for further analysis.

## Dataset Structure

The dataset is organized into folders, with one folder for each malware family.
Each folder contains the following:

- A representative malware sample file.
- A PCAP file containing the network traffic capture of the malware C&C communication.
- A JSON file categorizing the observed communication behavior according to our taxonomy.

## Research Paper

The dataset is used and introduced in the following paper:

## Usage

This dataset is intended for use by researchers and practitioners in the field of cybersecurity, particularly those interested in malware analysis and the study of malware communication strategies. 
The whole data set has been zip-compressed and the resulting archive has been protected using the password `infected`.
The malware files and network captures are not disarmed beyond zipping with a password.
We expect users to be sufficiently proficient with the use of such content and the application of self-protection measures such as working in dedicated, hardened analysis systems.
Thus, we reject any responsibility and liability for damages caused while working with the data set.
By using this dataset, users agree to cite the aforementioned paper in any publications that leverage the data provided.
